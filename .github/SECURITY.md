# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Open a **private** [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/meitarbe/cognetivy/security/advisories/new) (recommended), or email the maintainers if you need a private channel.
3. Include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and impact if possible.
4. We will acknowledge your report and aim to respond within a reasonable time. We may ask for more detail or work with you on a fix before publishing an advisory or CVE.

We appreciate your efforts to disclose vulnerabilities in a responsible manner.
