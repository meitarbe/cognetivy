Unlike general-purpose Cursor/Copilot, this would ship with pre-built templates, audit trails, and EU AI Act / HIPAA-ready workflows out of the box.",
      "why_now_thesis": "Three signals converge: (1) LLM code quality crossed the 95% HumanEval threshold (arxiv 2406.00515), making vertical specialization viable; (2) EU AI Act and GPAI Code of Practice (EC 2025) create mandatory compliance demand—enterprises need tools that bake this in; (3) 97% developer adoption (GitHub) but org support varies (US 88%, Germany 59%)—compliance-ready tools unlock the hesitant segment. High reliability: academic + regulatory primary sources.",

Market: $8B→$127B by 2032 (MarketsandMarkets); Cursor and Codeium validated capital availability. Gap: incumbents (Snyk, Sonar) are bolt-ons; no native AI repair platform.

But org support varies by region; 80% of licenses in use (Opsera) suggests under-provisioning. Enterprises need: governance, compliance mapping (EU AI Act), and proof of ROI (GitHub: 9.6→2.4 day time-to-PR). No dedicated adoption/ROI platform exists. Medium reliability: survey data.",
